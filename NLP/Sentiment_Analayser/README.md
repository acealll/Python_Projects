# Sentiment Analysis with Transformers

This project uses a pre-trained transformer model from the Hugging Face library to analyze the sentiment of user-provided sentences. The sentiment analysis pipeline determines whether the sentiment of the input text is positive or negative and provides a confidence score.

## Features

- **User Input:** Prompts the user to enter a sentence.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses Hugging Face's `transformers` library to determine the sentiment of the sentence.
- **Output:** Displays the sentiment label (positive/negative) and the confidence score.
